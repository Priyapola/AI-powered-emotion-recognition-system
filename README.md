# Emotion Recognition System

This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize human emotions based on facial expressions using a webcam or uploaded image/video.

## Dependencies

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Dlib

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install dependencies:

3. Run the emotion recognition system:

4. The system will use the webcam to detect faces and predict emotions in real-time.

## Pre-trained Model

The model `emotion_model.h5` is based on the FER-2013 dataset. It can be replaced with a different model trained on a custom dataset if needed.
